What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty repository is created with no commits in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The files in the staging area are a subset of the files in the working directory. These files are yet to be committed to the repository.It helps demarcate between actual commits and updates.
